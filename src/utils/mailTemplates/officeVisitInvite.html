    <h3>Why Join Special 26 Program</h3>
    <p>In IT Industry, demand for the Skilled candidates are very high. Companies are paying to Consultancies, 
        Conducting multiple Hiring drives in Search of Skilled Candidates. Companies are spending huge amount of 
        money and efforts to fill these positions but in absence of right candidates these positions left vacant. 
    </p>
    <p>Fresher’s who are passing out of the college are not Industry ready due to the lack of skills needed in 
        the current IT Industry. With the <b>highly Competetive IT industry environment</b>, Companies are not willing to hire
        candidates who needs to trained for multiple months before they become Productive to Company. They are looking 
        for Skilled Candidates who can start working on Products and Services and become Productive within few weeks of 
        Joining. Because of that <b>Getting The First JOB has become so Difficult.</b>
    </p>
    <p>Founders of  Newstein, having  several years of  industry experience understand this gap and decides to launch 
        a program which can help the fresher’s  to develop those skills (both technical as well as the behavioral ) 
        and make them industry ready from the day one. We already have the tie up with the multiple MNC and start ups 
        which are ready to hire such candidates immediately after the training .So  with the help of these tie ups 
        and our contacts in the industry, our internal recruitment team  will make sure that each of our candidates 
        will match to the appropriate position.
